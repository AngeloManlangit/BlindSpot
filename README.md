## About the Project

Blind Spot is an *offline-first*, AI-powered platform that predicts localized power and connectivity failures during typhoons, helping communities, hospitals, and LGUs prepare, respond, and recover before, during, and after disasters. Blind Spot aims to function as a disaster resilience engine within Cebu City that helps for the three phases around the full typhoon life cycle: pre-landfall, during landfall and post-landfall. Implementation will utilize a TypeScript-based backend for the risk engine and a Vue.js frontend for the offline-first PWA while a local caching system will store real-time data to ensure it remains accessible even when the device is offline. 

## How to Use
